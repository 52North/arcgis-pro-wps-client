## Description

This project was created initially during the [2019th GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6595064984240128).

This Add-In was created for ArcGIS Pro. It allows the users of the software to manage WPS providers within the software and offers a smooth integration. You can add multiple servers, preview the capabilities and execute your own processes. A history of your executed processes will be displayed in a results panel, where you can see the returned values or the path to the respective files.
